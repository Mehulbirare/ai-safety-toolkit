**The complete AI content moderation solution for developers.** Protect your AI applications from toxic content, detect PII automatically, and ensure compliance with GDPR, COPPA, and HIPAA.

Perfect for: ChatGPT apps, Claude integrations, AI chatbots, user-generated content platforms, and LLM applications.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
npm install safeguard-ai
```

```javascript
// CommonJS
const { SafeguardAI } = require('safeguard-ai');
// or ESM / TypeScript
// import { SafeguardAI } from 'safeguard-ai';

// PII detection and custom rules run locally with no API key.
// Provide an OpenAI API key to also enable AI text moderation.
const moderator = new SafeguardAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

const result = await moderator.checkText("Check this text for safety");

if (!result.safe) {
  console.log('Content flagged:', result.categories);
}
```

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Text Moderation** - Detect toxicity, hate speech, violence, sexual content  
✅ **PII Detection** - Find and redact emails, phones, SSN, credit cards  
✅ **Multi-Provider Support** - Currently supports OpenAI, with more coming soon  
✅ **Custom Rules** - Add your own blocked words and patterns  
✅ **GDPR Compliance** - Automatic PII detection for EU compliance  
✅ **TypeScript** - Full TypeScript support included  

## 🌟 The SafeguardAI Advantage

What sets SafeguardAI apart from standard moderation tools:

- **All-in-One Safety Stack**: Why use three different libraries for PII, Moderation, and Custom Rules? SafeguardAI unifies them into a single, high-performance toolkit.
- **Hybrid Processing**: Combines cutting-edge AI (for context-aware moderation) with optimized local patterns (for lightning-fast PII detection).
- **Privacy-First Design**: PII detection and redaction happen locally when possible, ensuring sensitive data never reaches external APIs unless you want it to.
- **Zero-Config Start**: Get up and running in seconds with sensible defaults, then scale to complex enterprise requirements with custom rules.
- **Future-Proof**: Built with a provider-agnostic architecture. Switch between OpenAI, Perspective, or Azure with minimal code changes.

## 💎 How It Helps You

SafeguardAI isn't just a library; it's a protector for your users and your business:

- **🛡️ Protect Your Community**: Automatically filter out toxic, hateful, or violent content in real-time, creating a safer space for your users.
- **🔒 Ensure Legal Compliance**: Effortlessly meet GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS requirements by catching sensitive personal data before it's stored or leaked.
- **📉 Reduce Operational Costs**: Minimize the need for expensive human moderation teams by automating 99% of regular content checks.
- **🤝 Build User Trust**: Show your users that you take their safety and privacy seriously by implementing transparent content safeguards.
- **🚀 Accelerate AI Development**: Focus on building your core AI features while we handle the complex logic of content safety and redaction.

### Check Text Safety

```javascript
const result = await moderator.checkText("Your text here");
/* Result:
{
  safe: false,
  flagged: true,
  categories: {
    toxicity: { detected: true, score: 0.89, severity: 'high' }
  },
  piiDetected: [
    { type: 'email', value: 'user@email.com', position: [45, 60] }
  ],
  cleanText: "Your text with [REDACTED] instead of PII",
  suggestions: ["Content flagged by OpenAI moderation.", "PII detected in text."]
}
*/
```

### Configure Provider

```javascript
const moderator = new SafeguardAI({
  apiKey: 'your-openai-api-key',
  providers: ['openai'],
  strictness: 'medium',
  redactPII: true // when true, `result.cleanText` has PII redacted
});
```

### Add Custom Rules

```javascript
moderator.rules.addBlockedWords(['badword1', 'badword2']);
moderator.rules.addPattern(/\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}/g, 'SSN');
```

## 📊 Use Cases

- **AI Chatbots** - Filter user messages before processing
- **Content Platforms** - Moderate user-generated content
- **Customer Support** - Detect PII in support tickets
- **Healthcare Apps** - HIPAA compliance for medical data
- **Financial Apps** - PCI-DSS compliance for payment info

## 📝 Changelog

### 1.0.2
- **Security:** Upgraded `axios` to `^1.17.0`, resolving several advisories (SSRF via `NO_PROXY` bypass, prototype-pollution auth bypass, JSON response tampering, CRLF injection).
- **Security:** The OpenAI provider no longer logs raw request errors, preventing the `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` header from leaking into application logs.
- **Fix:** Guard against unexpected OpenAI API response shapes instead of throwing an unhandled `TypeError`.
- **Fix:** Corrected invalid `package.json` (a trailing comma broke `npm install`/`npm publish`).
